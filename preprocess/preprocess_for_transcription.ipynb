So that's pretty much what we do. One of the brands that work with this VP. And I think this whole thing started because Krishna who's our CEO is friends with Heather. I think they might somewhere. Yeah. And she told me that this tool called Hightouch. And, you know, you can push data to add platforms and for BP, and we created this… customer table of customer 360 the way I like to call it, you know, creating segments, trying to push them to add platforms that's what we have used Hightouch for I don't know if the Facebook thing is working yet.

So when it comes to, you know, managing API, getting visibility into the quality of data that's passing from big query to all of these downstream systems, security… all the more like enterprise features under the hood that you would have to go and try to build that yourself. Hightouch has already been working on that for the last two and a half years and that's all we do, you know, or a purpose built architecture for sending data from data warehouse like big query, snowflake, you know, pick your data warehouse to these downstream systems. So all you have to worry about is okay, like let's focus on modeling really quality data customer, 360 tables like you're doing for VPN. Let's focus on that and making that as valuable as possible. We don't have to worry about all the plumbing in between. So we can just focus on like what are the actual direct outcomes we can get with this data from big query in these app platforms to maximize ad spend, to maximize subscriptions. I probably new do a little research on BP and myself to understand or the subscription based, you know, where can we really help them turn the needle? But I work with one of folks in the eCommerce space as well. So does John, so like there's a lot of like enterprise features that come along with Hightouch, like our D BT integration, the observe observability features. So you can see like, okay, what's like? Is this data actually coming going from point a to point B? If it's not, why is it failing? How much is failing? We also have our audiences platform which for your use cases might be very intriguing.

So when you're trying to look at like discount seekers, things like that, are you just building that in the warehouse and you make them like data marts or like TBT models there. And then you're pushing them downstream but they're defined that. Is that what it looks like? Yeah, got it. Okay. And when it comes to the requirements for this segmentation, does BPM, does their marketing team reach out to you directly and they say, hey, like here's, the types of segmentation we'd like to do, can you build this in the data warehouse to ship downstream? Is that basically the flow? Okay? So… we have that audience platform which allows instead of doing the segmentation solely in the data warehouse where, you know, it's gonna be yourself, whoever on your team is having to go in and actually manually do that. Hightouch allows you to do that segmentation downstream in the Hightouch platform through that no code interface. So say you want to empower the VPN team. So instead of having to go through your team every time they want to test out a new segmentation use case or tweak something on the models that are actually sending downstream, we have that no, no code interface. So the market is, instead of having to know SQL or like no DB T, now in Hightouch, they can just ask the question to ask, you know, give me all my customers that have these defined list of criteria and then they themselves can like be empowered to send those audiences downstream to all the platforms. So I'm not sure like… it's something that I'd say a lot of eCommerce customers find a lot of value from one just like the agility and speed that comes with it. If your marketing team, your marketing team in this case, being the BP and team, once you start doing experimentation, they want to do some AB testing on different… audience segments and they want to do it quickly.
