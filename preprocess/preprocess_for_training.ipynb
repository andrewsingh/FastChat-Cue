      "CDPs are used to help companies get data into their business tools like their marketing tools to run more targeted and effective campaigns. Hightouch provides a Composable CDP solution by helping companies leverage the data in their data warehouse for marketing campaigns. Hightouch syncs data from warehouses directly into SaaS tools to enable personalized marketing, sales and support experiences. It is different from a traditional CDP like Segment because traditional CDPs are less flexible.\n",

      "Use case: \n",
      "- Saras Analytics is using Hightouch to create a customer table or customer 360 for VPN and push segments to ad platforms like Google, Bing, and TikTok. They are trying to sync data from BigQuery to these platforms to provide visibility and insights to brands.\n",

They are facing authentication issues with Facebook and have filled out a form provided by Hightouch to resolve the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objections:\n",
      "- The prospect is unsure if the additional features of Hightouch, such as the no-code interface for segmentation, would provide significant value for VPN at the moment. They are primarily focused on the core use case of syncing segments to ad platforms.\n",
