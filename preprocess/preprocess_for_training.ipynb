      "The following is a transcript of an introductory sales call between a sales representative at Hightouch, a data integration company, and a prospect at Saras Analytics, an internet software and services company. The sales rep at Hightouch is John Alderman, and the prospect at Saras Analytics is Ashraf. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hightouch overview:\n",
      "CDPs are used to help companies get data into their business tools like their marketing tools to run more targeted and effective campaigns. Hightouch provides a Composable CDP solution by helping companies leverage the data in their data warehouse for marketing campaigns. Hightouch syncs data from warehouses directly into SaaS tools to enable personalized marketing, sales and support experiences. It is different from a traditional CDP like Segment because traditional CDPs are less flexible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saras Analytics information:\n",
      "Industry: internet software and services\n",
      "Size: medium-sized business\n",
      "Description: Saras Analytics is a data management company that aids in growth by solving data challenges for e-commerce brands, aggregators, and agencies alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key points from transcript:\n",
      "Use case: \n",
      "- Saras Analytics is using Hightouch to create a customer table or customer 360 for VPN and push segments to ad platforms like Google, Bing, and TikTok. They are trying to sync data from BigQuery to these platforms to provide visibility and insights to brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current solution:\n",
      "- Saras Analytics is currently using dbt to define tables in BigQuery and create customer segments. They are pushing these segments from BigQuery to Hightouch to sync with ad platforms. They are facing authentication issues with Facebook and have filled out a form provided by Hightouch to resolve the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objections:\n",
      "- The prospect is unsure if the additional features of Hightouch, such as the no-code interface for segmentation, would provide significant value for VPN at the moment. They are primarily focused on the core use case of syncing segments to ad platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Competition:\n",

      "CDPs are used to help companies get data into their business tools like their marketing tools to run more targeted and effective campaigns. Hightouch provides a Composable CDP solution by helping companies leverage the data in their data warehouse for marketing campaigns. Hightouch syncs data from warehouses directly into SaaS tools to enable personalized marketing, sales and support experiences. It is different from a traditional CDP like Segment because traditional CDPs are less flexible.\n",

They want to ensure that the MailChimp tags are consistent with the tags in Airtable so that they can segment their emails appropriately.\n",
